# Turtle Graphics
Date: 7/18/2021<br>

## What is Turtle Graphics?
Turtle graphics provides a representation of a physical “turtle” (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor. It's an effective and well-proven way for learners to encounter programming concepts and interact with software, as it provides instant, visible feedback.
[Since we are coding with Java, we will use console commands; no physical turtle :'( ] <br>

## Project Aim
This Java program implements the Turtle Graphics using console commands!
